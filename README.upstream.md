A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon- Dark Mode Theme - Based on the Official Color Palette Created by Ethan Schoonover.

At last, a Solarized desktop theme is available with general appeal. Introducing Solarized-Material-Complete-Desktop. Solarized-Material adheres to both Material-Design standards as well as those put forth by the official Solarized Color Palette. The fruits of this combination are a real bonus for those who need the scheme because they have to use their computers for hours - but still wish it to look elegant during those long periods.

Solarized-Dark-Mode - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Material-Solerized GTK dark-mode-scheme strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark-Mode - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Material Design elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, cursor designer Wojciech Kalinowski, and full-stack web-developer/themer Pavel Agarkov, with an overlay of the original standard Solarized theming created by Ethan Schoonover.

The Suru-grounded icon set was initially designed and developed by Sam Hewitt - under GPL3. The original Suru icon set and concept was created by Matthieu James - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are Andrea Bonanni (original author) and Gustavo Costa . Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by Keefer Rourke - under GPL3/MIT. Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT.


Chose from either the Complete-Desktop file or the three separate GTK-desktop, icons, or cursor files.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

For Cursors: 1) Same as with the icons, extract the "tar.xz" files into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the cursors to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes, icons, and cursors.
