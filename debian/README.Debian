The exact copyright years and license details are not available for the 
material-solarized-suru++ icon set. There is a list of contributors in
icons/Material-Solarized-Suru++/index.theme 
which has been copied into debian/copyright and arbitrarily given a GPL3 licence.

Such vague attribution would certainly disqualify this package 
from being released by Debian.
